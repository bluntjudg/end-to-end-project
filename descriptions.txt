csv consists of the rainfall data , we will be classifying the rainfall 

preprocessing is already done by sir 

data- find the dependent & independent variable 
df.describe().T -  to transform the data while descriptions only - used for comparison of the data 
every string in python is object

df.columns = df.columns.str.strip() - to remove the spacing in data 

ex:- '    winddirection' - here the column name consists the spacing so the strip functions removes the spacing 
output:- 'winddirection'
to drop the null values - df.isnull().sum()

Q. there is one empty value so what should we do - impute or drop ?
ans:- the ratio of the missing value is very less, if imputing the data might reflect the changes 
to drop the data then the proportion of the missing value in the data must be less than 5% & should be Missing places at random 

.map() - function to convert object to int yes-1 no-0

--> if the data is imbalanced we have used downsampling 
    > using random choice we can use the higher sampling data to make both the data same -> example of downsampling

models to train --> svm, logistic regression, decision tree

hyper parameter tuning - to increase the accuracy of the model
